# ⏱️ Teal Glow Stopwatch

Hey there! 👋  
This is a **cool stopwatch web app** I built using **HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript**. It has a glowing teal theme, lap recording, dark mode, and even a floating GitHub badge with my username!

I made this project to practice my frontend skills and learn how to make a user interface that actually looks fun to use.  
Hope you like it! 💚

## 🚀 Features

✨ **Teal Neon Design**  
The whole stopwatch is styled with a teal color scheme and glowing hover effects to make it stand out.

🕒 **Start, Pause, Reset, Lap**  
You can control the timer and also record laps, which get listed in a scrollable box.

🌙 **Dark Mode Switch**  
Click the toggle to switch between light and dark themes — all done with pure JavaScript and CSS.

⚡ **Animated Buttons + Hover Effects**  
The buttons glow when you hover over them, and the timer text highlights too!

There’s a glowing box on the side that links to my GitHub profile 👉 [stardust-xt](https://github.com/stardust-xt)
